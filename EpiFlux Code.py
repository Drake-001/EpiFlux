# BEGIN EpiFlux

#   IMPORT necessary PyTorch libraries
  
#   DEFINE dataset 
#     # This could be a collection of statements, facts, or experiences that the primary network uses to form beliefs
  
#   DEFINE primary_network 
#     # This network will take input data and produce some form of belief or knowledge representation
  
#   DEFINE secondary_network
#     # This network will take the outputs (beliefs) of the primary network and evaluate/reflect upon them

#   DEFINE training_loop
#     FOR each epoch
#       FOR each data_point in dataset
#         primary_belief = primary_network(data_point)
#         evaluation = secondary_network(primary_belief)
        
#         CALCULATE loss using the evaluation and desired outcomes
#         BACKPROPAGATE through both networks to optimize weights

#   EXECUTE training_loop

#   EVALUATE final beliefs and evaluations
#     # Assess how primary network's beliefs have stabilized and what the secondary network's reflections reveal about them

#   DRAW insights 
#     # Analyze and interpret results in context of Rortyâ€™s philosophical ideas and implications for AI model interpretability
